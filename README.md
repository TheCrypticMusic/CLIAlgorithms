CLIAlgorithms

CLIAlgorithms is a command-line interface (CLI) application that takes the user through algorithms in a step-by-step manner via the CLI. This application is mainly used as a learning platform for those looking to learn and understand various algorithms.

Implemented Algorithms:

Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

Linear Search

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that searches for an element in a list by sequentially checking each element until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
